# KFC_database-project
Database final-term project !

Due to covid 19 pandemic, cities most popular restaurant KFC decided 
to show food menu on the billboard instead of hard copy where the name 
of food, food code, price, quantity and vat of foods also written clearly. 
KFC restaurant is identified by license number, location, branch id, 
phone number. When customers enter any branch of KFC, there they see 
a billboard and from there they can choose many meals and order to the 
waiter. Every waiter can take many orders from many customers and 
send the list to the right chef. All the chefs prepare all ordered items as 
fast as they can. Then prepared food taking out by the waiter to the 
customer. Many customers come to the restaurant at a time. And every 
customer is identified by their name, age, serial number, table number, 
phone number. When a person wants to join a KFC restaurant as an 
employee, he has to submit his necessary documents like his name, age, 
phone number. In every branch of KFC, there is a manager who looks 
after the restaurant. But joining as a manager position, he has to extra 
submit the educational certificate. And in chef and waiter position, has 
to submit accordingly cooking and working experience certificate in this 
sector. After joining everyone get their unique id number and salary
from the KFC restaurant. And these things can easily record by a 
database system and we can also modify any information we want. 
Ultimately it allows us to keep all the information of any restaurant.
